## Weather Forcaster

UCF Coding Bootcamp Week 3 Challange 2. 


The purpose of this challenge was to learn how to familiarize, impliment, and utilize server side API's. I called the openWeather 5 day forcast API and used it to create a display that would show a weather forecast for the next 5 days.
